# Hungry Turtle Path Planner
Plan a 2D path for a mobile robot given poor quality and uncertain data in a dynamically changing environment.

Many planners are designed to operate in an environment that is well mapped.  This planner is designed for unmapped environments.  It attempts to operate as if are an animal with poor vision that is released area it has never been in before.  All the animal can do is walk in a general direction where it thinks food might be and try not to collide with trees of run off a cliff.  Hence the name "Hungry Turtle".  The turtle wants to walk to a point it can't see and has never been to before. It can
only see the rocks and trees that are in its line of sight but can not know what is behind these.  The turtle tries to make the best decision it can with very limited information.

It is assumed there is a high-level path planner that gives this planner a "goal point" that is relatively close.  This planner will apply real-time sensor data to avoid collision with obstacles.   We assume the sensor data is imprecise and not well localized.   The algorithm is like A* but with a recursion depth limit that may stop the search before it finds a complete path.    But thinking again about the turtle, It does not know its exact location. It can only walk it a general direction while trying to avoid only what it can see.
