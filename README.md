# Hungry Turtle Path Planner
Plan a 2D path for a mobile robot given poor quality and uncertin data in a dynamically changing environment.

Many planners are designed to operate in an environment that is well mapped.   This planner attemps to operate as if if are an anamal with poor vision that is released area it has never been in before.  All thepoor animal can do is walk in a general direction where it thinks food might be and and try not to collide with trees of run off a cliff.  Hence the name "Hungry Turtle".  The turtle wants to walk to a spto it can't see and has never been to before. It can
only see the rocks ad trees that are in its line of sight but can not knw what is behend these.  The turtle tries to make the best decision it can whith very limited information.

It is assumed there is a high level path planner tha gives this planner a "goal point" that is relatively close.  This planner will apply real-time sensor data to avoid colisions with obstacles.   We assume the sensor data is imprecise and not well locaized.   The algorithm is like A* but with a recursion depth limit that may stop the search before it finds a complete path.    But thinking again about the turtle, It does not know its exact location. It can only walk it a general directin while trying to aviod only what it can see.
